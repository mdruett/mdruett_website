<strong><a href="projectsAMRVAC">AMRVAC</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://amrvac.org">AMRVAC</a> project is headed by Prof. Rony Keppens in KU Leuven, Belgium. AMRVAC is a code with an adaptive grid (Adaptive Mesh Refinement) and the Versatile Advection Code (hence AMRVAC) to model flows in a wide variety of physical situations.</li>
    <li>I joined the AMRVAC project in November 2021, and have been working primarily on solar flare simulations in 2D and 3D, collaborating with Dr. Wenzhi Ruan and Prof. Keppens.</li>

<strong><a href="projectsBifrost">Bifrost</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201116520">Bifrost</a> project is headed by Prof. Mats Carlsson in RoCS, Oslo University, Norway. The Bifrost code is the state-of.the-art simulation code for the solar chromosphere, and the solar atmosphere in general. It accruately reproduces many solar features from the lower atmosphere in 2D and 3D.</li>
    <li>I have been a member of the Bifrost team since 2018, when I joined through collaboration with my work in Stockholm University. My collaborators are Prof. Jorrit Leenaarts, Prof. Mats Carlsson, and Dr. Mikolaj Syzdlarski. I have been working with developing the passive tracer particle module, "corks" and using them to studying the formation processes of solar fibrils. Our work has been published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, where the first work was also used as cover art for the journal.</li>

<strong><a href="projectsHYDRO2GEN">HYDRO2GEN</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201116520">HYDRO2GEN</a> project is headed by Prof. Valentina Zharkova, Emeritus professor at Northumbria University, UK. This 1D hydrodynamic, radiative transfer conde considered the flow and transport of energy along a field line in a solar flare. I was in charge of developing the radiative transfer part of this code, with Prof. Zharkova taking charge of the hydrodynamic part. The solution method of the radiative transfer equation employs the L1 and L2 approximations of Ivanov and Serbin (1984) which provide a quick way of obtaining non-LTE solutions of the statistical equilbirium radiative transfer equations. These methods may prove a useful stepping stone for non-statistical equilibirium methods that use an intial estimate. A more flexible version of this code will become HYDRO3GEN in the future..</li>
    <li>Our work using this code has been published many times, with our first publication in Nature communications, studying the origin of the large Doppler red-shifts seen at the onsets of solar flares. It was for my work with this code that I was awarded my PhD from Northumbria University in 2018.</li>
