  <ul>
    <li><strong>Status</strong>: <strong>Open for submissions. email abstract to: malcolm dot druett at kuleuven dot be</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (KU Leuven, Belgium), Dr Natasha Jeffrey (Northumbria University, UK)</li>

    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Solar flares are the result of many complex large and small scale plasma processes occurring in the Sunâ€™s atmosphere. Driven by access to the latest generation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) services, higher dimensional models of solar flares are finally becoming feasible and a series of flagship 3D flare simulations have recently been published in high impact journals. Thus, we stand at a key point in time to evaluate and discuss the essential inclusions, assumptions, and simplifications in flare modelling. These will steer models made in the future, in terms of accurately reproducing physics and observational features from the upcoming generation of satellite, and ground-based observatories. In this meeting, we will highlight the fundamental differences in behaviours between higher-dimensional models and their lower dimensional counterparts. We will explore the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches applied in order to make 3D modelling feasible in the current era of computing. To do this, we solicit contributions covering complementary themes, designed to bring together important aspects of comprehensively modelling solar flares in 2D and 3D. Specifically, we will discuss (1) Magnetic reconnection in 2D and 3D (e.g., magnetic island formation, fragmentation, oscillatory reconnection), discussing effective ways to handle the multi-scale nature of models that include accurate reconnection regions in large-scale atmospheres and (2) From reconnection to particle energisation (e.g. energisation, escape and transport over extended regions, non-uniform plasma conditions, realistic magnetic field configurations) exploring the state-of-the-art regarding combined modelling linking the kinetic and macroscopic scales. In
tandem, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of 2D and 3D flare modelling such as (i) retaining essential physics whilst enabling 3D simulations using modern HPC facilities, (ii) discuss new insights gained from 3D models of flares and (iii) address future improvements.
