    <h3><a href="https://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2025/public.asp?page=home.asp">2025.07.27-08-01 Asia Oceania Geophysical Society 22nd Annual General Meeting (AOGS) 2025</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status</strong>: <a href="https://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2025/public.asp?page=submissions.asp">Submissions Open until 2025.02.18</a></li>
      <li><strong>Meeting</strong>: The eight geoscience disciplines of the society—Atmospheric (AS), Biogeoscience (BG), Hydrological (HS) Interdisciplinary (IG), Ocean (OS), Planetary (PS), Solar & Terrestrial (ST), and Solid Earth (SE) —are the focus of the annual meeting, which is open to scientists, researchers, and practitioners in these fields.</li>
      <li><strong>Session title</strong>: ST17: Advances In Our Understanding of Plasma Flows and Waves in the Solar Atmosphere From Single, Multi-fluid, and Kinetic Model Perspectives</li>
      <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (University of Sheffield, UK), Prof. Viktor Fedun (University of Sheffield, UK), Prof. Abhishekh Kumar Srivastava (Department of Physics, IIT (BHU), India), Dr Dr. Wenzhi Ruan (MPS, Germany), Dr Sergiy Shelyag (Flinders University, Australia)</li>
      <li><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/expo-and-convention.html">Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore</a></li>
      <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern high spatial and temporal resolution numerical and observational studies of dynamical solar processes e.g. flares, CMEs, vortices, and jets provide us with unprecedented possibilities to understand various plasma-waves and flow-related physical processes in the solar atmosphere and beyond. The development of theoretical models of the solar environment is essential to represent the complex interactions between magnetic fields, plasma flows and waves. In quiet-Sun and active regions, this interplay can result in turbulence generation, solar flares, vortex motion formation, plasma jet propulsion, and the beginning of instabilities. The combination of data from modern space and ground-based solar instruments, e.g.,  Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Aditya-L1, IRIS, CHASE, COSMO, DKIST, DST, BBSO and SST with the simulation capabilities of codes such as ARMS, Bifrost, CO5BOLD, MURaM, MPI-AMRVAC, SAC, Ramen, and R2D2 empower us to interpret, theorise, forecast behaviours, as well as provide requirements for the design of future instrumentation and codes to be capable of answering scientific questions related to our understanding of coronal heating, the origin of supersonic wind, solar activity, and further concatenating to space weather. In the framework of the proposed session, we will be focussing on:
      <ul>
        <li>energy transport mechanisms within solar flares,</li> 
        <li>the role of non-thermal particles,</li> 
        <li>plasma vortical structures and how they support wave propagation and energy supply to the upper layers of the solar atmosphere,</li> 
        <li>multi-scale (non-)linear MHD wave excitation and propagation.</li> 
      </ul>
This session will provide a timely platform for joint discussions between world-leading experts, early career researchers and PhD students in solar observational analysis and numerical or analytical modelling.</li>

        <li>To provide a platform for collaborations and dissemination channels between the solar, stellar, planetary and exoplanetary communities.</li> 
        <li>To provide an update about the PLATO mission (ESA’s next medium-class mission, which will continuously observe over 200,000 FGKM-dwarf stars with high cadence and quality for at least 2 years) and discuss its stellar and planetary characterisation potential.</li> 
      </ul>
We particularly encourage applications with relevance to the Sun-as-a-star, discoveries in Stellar physics with relevance to the Sun, advances in exoplanet discovery and characterisation, and Extreme space weather events and habitability.

    <h3><a href="meetings2023RAS">2023.01.13 RAS Specialist Discussion Meeting: New generation multi-dimensional (2D/3D) and multi-scale modelling of solar flares; from reconnection to particle energisation and beyond</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status</strong>: Completed</li>
      <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (KU Leuven, Belgium), Dr Natasha Jeffrey (Northumbria University, UK)</li>
      <li><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://burlingtonhouse.org/">Burlington House, London, UK</a></li>
      <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Solar flares are the result of many complex large and small scale plasma processes occurring in the Sun’s atmosphere. Driven by access to the latest generation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) services, higher dimensional models of solar flares are finally becoming feasible and a series of flagship 3D flare simulations have recently been published in high impact journals. Thus, we stand at a key point in time to evaluate and discuss the essential inclusions, assumptions, and simplifications in flare modelling. These will steer models made in the future, in terms of accurately reproducing physics and observational features from the upcoming generation of satellite, and ground-based observatories. In this meeting, we will highlight the fundamental differences in behaviours between higher-dimensional models and their lower dimensional counterparts. We will explore the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches applied in order to make 3D modelling feasible in the current era of computing. To do this, we solicit contributions covering complementary themes, designed to bring together important aspects of comprehensively modelling solar flares in 2D and 3D. Specifically, we will discuss (1) Magnetic reconnection in 2D and 3D (e.g., magnetic island formation, fragmentation, oscillatory reconnection), discussing effective ways to handle the multi-scale nature of models that include accurate reconnection regions in large-scale atmospheres and (2) From reconnection to particle energisation (e.g. energisation, escape and transport over extended regions, non-uniform plasma conditions, realistic magnetic field configurations) exploring the state-of-the-art regarding combined modelling linking the kinetic and macroscopic scales. In
tandem, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of 2D and 3D flare modelling such as (i) retaining essential physics whilst enabling 3D simulations using modern HPC facilities, (ii) discuss new insights gained from 3D models of flares and (iii) address future improvements.
