<strong><a href="conferences2023RAS">2023.01.13 RAS Specialist Discussion Meeting</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Status</strong>: <strong>Open for submissions. email abstract to: malcolm dot druett at kuleuven dot be</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (KU Leuven, Belgium), Dr Natasha Jeffrey (Northumbria University, UK)</li>
    <li><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://burlingtonhouse.org/">Burlington House, London, UK</a></li>
    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Solar flares are the result of many complex large and small scale plasma processes occurring in the Sun’s atmosphere. Driven by access to the latest generation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) services, higher dimensional models of solar flares are finally becoming feasible and a series of flagship 3D flare simulations have recently been published in high impact journals. Thus, we stand at a key point in time to evaluate and discuss the essential inclusions, assumptions, and simplifications in flare modelling. These will steer models made in the future, in terms of accurately reproducing physics and observational features from the upcoming generation of satellite, and ground-based observatories. In this meeting, we will highlight the fundamental differences in behaviours between higher-dimensional models and their lower dimensional counterparts. We will explore the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches applied in order to make 3D modelling feasible in the current era of computing. To do this, we solicit contributions covering complementary themes, designed to bring together important aspects of comprehensively modelling solar flares in 2D and 3D. Specifically, we will discuss (1) Magnetic reconnection in 2D and 3D (e.g., magnetic island formation, fragmentation, oscillatory reconnection), discussing effective ways to handle the multi-scale nature of models that include accurate reconnection regions in large-scale atmospheres and (2) From reconnection to particle energisation (e.g. energisation, escape and transport over extended regions, non-uniform plasma conditions, realistic magnetic field configurations) exploring the state-of-the-art regarding combined modelling linking the kinetic and macroscopic scales. In
tandem, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of 2D and 3D flare modelling such as (i) retaining essential physics whilst enabling 3D simulations using modern HPC facilities, (ii) discuss new insights gained from 3D models of flares and (iii) address future improvements.

<strong><a href="https://solarmhd2022.com">2022.08.07-10 Solar MHD 2022</a></strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Status</strong>: Completed</li>
    <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (KU Leuven, Belgium), Dr Suzana Silva (University of Sheffield, UK), Dr Rahul Sharma (Northumbria University, UK)</li>
    <li><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://www.theviewhoteleastbourne.com/">The View Hotel Eastbourne</a></li>
    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: The meeting will cover a number of topics related to the analysis of data obtained in solar MHD simulations and their interpretation in connection to high spatial and temporal resolution observations. In particular, sessions are planned regarding: 
      <ul>
        <li>Simulating excitation and propagation of MHD waves in solar plasma,</li> 
        <li>Simulating plasma instabilities,</li> 
        <li>Effective numerical tools towards more realistic physics in modelling,</li> 
        <li>Numerical simulations and spectral line synthesis,</li> 
        <li>Identification and analysis of plasma flows.</li> 
      </ul>
​
Talks and interactive sessions regarding state-of-the-art codes such as Bifrost, MANCHA, MURaM, PENCIL, LARE3D and AMRVAC will be used to look at instabilities, heating, waves, and the physics needed to replicate observations in the new high-resolution era of telescopes and satellites. Comparisons and contrasts between the codes will be investigated.

Discussion time has been scheduled to ensure a hands-on approach as well as the interaction between the scientists and allow for the generation of ideas for collaboration. Our aim is to develop new projects, leading to publications and grant applications. </li>

    <li><strong>Status</strong>: Completed</li>
    <li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Dr Malcolm Druett (Stockholm University, Sweden), Dr Ben Snow (Exeter University, UK)</li>
    <li><strong>Article</strong>: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atab058">New eyes and ideas for the chromosphere</a></li>
    <li><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://burlingtonhouse.org/">Burlington House, London, UK</a></li>
    <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: This year, numerous telescopes and cutting edge instruments are seeing first light as well as satellites being launched that will observe the solar photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region with unparalleled spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. In this session, observational discoveries will be simultaneously compared to, and contrasted with, the latest breakthroughs from numerical models of the chromosphere. 

 Specifically the following issues will be addressed:

      <ol>
        <li>Advances in instrumentation for observing the lower solar atmosphere.</li> 
        <li>New insights from numerical modelling and observations of chromospheric features such as fibrils, spicules, jets, Ellerman bombs, and flares, as well as the energy transported via particles and waves in such features.</li> 
        <li>The transport of energy between the chromosphere and the photosphere or corona, and how new discoveries alter our understanding of the fundamental energy budgets of the solar atmosphere.</li> 
      </ul>
​The goals are the dissemination of new ideas and addressing ongoing debates informed by the latest information.
